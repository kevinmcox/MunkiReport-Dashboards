# MunkiReport-Dashboards

Customizable [Dashboards](https://github.com/munkireport/munkireport-php/wiki/Dashboards) were added to [MunkiReport](https://github.com/munkireport/munkireport-php) in version 4.0 and give admins the ability to have an unlimited number of customized views with particular widgets for different reporting needs.

The examples included in this repository were created for a presentation I gave at a [Houston Apple Admins](https://houstonappleadmins.org) meetup and are referenced on my blog in [Configuring MunkiReport Dashboards](https://www.kevinmcox.com/2020/05/configuring-munkireport-dashboards/).
